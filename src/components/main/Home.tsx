        <h1>Greetings,</h1>
        <p className="intro">
        
          I'm Caleb Norris, a junior software engineer and new grad now based in
          South Jordan, Utah, relocating from Washingon state. I enjoy crafting
          things that live on the internet, whether that be websites,
          applications, or anything in between. I have a desire to learn and
          grow as a developer as I navigate this industry to find my first
          full-time position as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="about">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy spending
          time doing various hobbies of mine! I'm a fan of the outdoors, I love
          to go hiking, fishing, camping, and more. Being a nerd, I also am a
          big PC gamer. Health is also very important to me, a lot of my time is
          spent lifting weights, doing cardio, and attempting to cook healthy
          meals.
        </p>
        <br />
